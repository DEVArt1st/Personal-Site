      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="about-description">I am currently a high school student and working to becoming a full stack web developer! I really enjoyed games and game development at first sight, but resulted in picking up web development and
        found it to be an easy
        going workflow. I am also very interested in horses and/or equine where I get to spend time outside the most!</p>
      <br>
      <p class="about-description">As a resourceful and dedicated person I give all my energy and time to attain my goals. I'm constantly absorbed in learning the newest technologies, and strive for success in all that I do! I'm a self taught
        programmer and high school
        student
        pushing towards my biggest goals!</p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>With the power of technology, I was introduced as a child and, as I have matured with new opportunities everyday I take the advantage of owning the newest computer technologies and applying new technical skill to those computers everyday.
          With
          an outcome of self-discipline to learning such new expertise. I am able to depoly those skills into real life solutions for communities and bussiness!</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>With the latest technologies comes the most improved development languages! From the beginning where I first started programming inside of Unity's engine to, working inside of custom game engines, open
          source engines, that eventually lead to web and digital applications
          development. I have seen and learned alot in these past years in my journy as a developer. I started with C# and pushing my way to an even broader amount of languages such as C++, Javascrip, HTML, CSS, and much more. With such knowledge of
          these computer languages, creativity expands immersively!</p>
